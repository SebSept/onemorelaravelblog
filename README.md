# Features & requirements

What I need for my blog is :

- fast rendering (suited for not powerfull shared hosting)
- lightweight (coded only what I need)
- good code (for future improvements)
- one user admin
- comments
- tags

That's all.

So features are :

- posts
- tags
- comments (moderated)
- markdown rendering
- laravel powered
- composer powered
- sqlite powered (but can be configured to run on mysql or other database engine).
- i18n

[Laravel](http://laravel.com/ "Laravel framework website") is the framework I'm currently trying to adopt (for fast / simple projects at least). So it's laravel powered.

For the moment, it does the job I want it to do.

# Improvements

Behaviour testing, translations, a way to hook module, a base theme, documentation to mention the most important stuffs.
